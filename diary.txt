6/04:

Worked on basic bloom filter functionality for
daily bloom filter (DBF)

8/04:

completed bloom filter functionality for DBF, CBF and QBF's.

13/04:
 
began working on integrating the seperate cryptographic components into Dimy.py and DimyServer.py files.

16/04:

udp client now encodes encounter id's into a daily bloom filter
a second timer was added to the client to determine when new dbf's and qbf's should be made
qbf successfully generated

18/04:

began writing the tcp backend server DimyServer.py which can accept a bloom filter for either query or storage purposes

19/04:

tcp server can now accept queries and uploads
time_until_covid can be given to a node, after which it will act as though it has recieved a diagnosis
the system is passing a three minute test with dbf at 90s, and one node having covid at 120s

20/04

created a constants file for easier varying of parameters such as dbf expiry time, qbf creation time, id generation time and broadcast interval
improved the print messages for both the nodes and the tcp server

all is in place except for possible timestamping of id shares
